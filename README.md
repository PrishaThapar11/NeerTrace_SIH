# NeerTrace_SIH
NeerTrace: Real-time water quality monitoring and heavy metal pollution analysis using Streamlit.

# 🌊 NeerTrace

 Detect. Visualize. Protect. 🛡️

NeerTrace is a **real-time water quality monitoring tool** built with Streamlit. It helps researchers, environmentalists, and policymakers quickly **detect heavy metal contamination** in water and **visualize pollution levels** on interactive maps.

## ⚡ Key Features

- 📁 **Batch CSV Upload** – Upload real-world sensor or survey data instantly.  
- 🔬 **Single-Sample Analysis** – Enter water sample data manually and get results immediately.  
- 📊 **Pollution Indices Computed** – CF (Contamination Factor), Igeo (Geoaccumulation Index), PLI (Pollution Load Index), HMPI (Heavy Metal Pollution Index).  
- 🗺️ **Interactive Maps** – Color-coded markers for pollution severity.  
- 💾 **Downloadable Reports** – Export computed indices as CSV for research or reporting.
